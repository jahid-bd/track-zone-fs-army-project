# Track Zone Project

I have created a frontend react world clock type or freelancer clock application. If you need to watch the world's many cities or country's times or you need to know the time difference between your time or other time to another time and if you want to create events another times then you can use this application.

## Application features are :

1. In this application, you can see a base clock based on your local time but you can change your base clock time or title by custom time or set another time zones but you could not delete base clock.
2. You can create multiple clocks as you need based on many time zones or you can create custom times and titles.
3. You can edit time and title or delete these created clocks.
4. You can see the time difference between your base clock and created clocks.
5. In this created clocks you can set multiple events with date, time and title on these created clock times or date but you can see the times or dates in your base clock.
6. These events you can edit or delete.
